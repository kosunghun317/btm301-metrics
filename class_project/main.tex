    \begin{block}{Background}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Free agent contracts in baseball are determined by various factors
            \item Performance and non-performance factors are considered
            \item Performance factors include statistics like ERA, OBP, etc.
            \item Non-performance factors include team attendance, salary cap usage, etc.
        \end{itemize}
